# PacMen_Exercise

# Description:
This project allows a user to generate Pac Men at the click of a button.  You can add as many as you would like.  Once you have created all of your Pac Men, click on the Start Game button to see your Pac Men move around the screen. 

# How to Run:
Download all files to your local machine.  Drop the Index.html file on to a blank web page.  Click on the Add PacMan button to add an individual Pac Man.  Continue to click this button until you are done creating Pac Men.  Then click on the Start Game button.  Each time you click the Start Game button, your Pac Men will move at a greater speed.  Refresh your page to start over.

# Future Roadmap
Additional features I would like to add to this project are:
  - Varying the color of the Pac Men
  - Provide the ability to speed up or slow down the Pac Men
